    <h2> About </h2>

    <p class="life"> Emily Dickinson was born on 10th Decemember 1830 in Amherst, U.S. <br>
        She died on 15th May 1886 in Amherst. <br> 
        Her sister Lavinia found her books of poetry and began the process of making the poetry public. <br>
        The first collection entitled Poems by Emily Dickinson was published in 1890 and was met with praise. <br>
        Opinions regarding the poet's talents were mixed in the twentieth century, <br>
        but <br>
        she is now one of the most important icons in American Poetry despite being unrecognised during her time. </p>
        <figure class="quote">
            <blockquote>
                Do I repine, is it all murmuring, or am I sad and lone, and cannot, 
                cannot help it? Sometimes when I do feel so, 
                I think it may be wrong, and that God will punish me by taking you away; 
                for he is very kind to let me write to you, and to give me your sweet letters, 
                but my heart wants more. </blockquote>

    <p class="life"> Most of her work as a poet was hidden from her family and the surrounding community until after her death in 1886. <br>
         Only ten poems out of the 1800 she wrote were published during her lifetime. <br> 
         The majority of the writing Dickinson completed in the next decade was included in letters. <br>
         Her most popular correspondents were her brother Austin, and a collection of female friends including her future sister in law Susan Gilbert. <br>
         In 1858, Dickinson began to organize her massive volumes of poetry into manuscript-books. <br>
         Over the course of seven years she compiled about 800 poems into neat bundles. <br>
         Her intent with this collection is unknown, but it seems likely she was readying her work to be published posthumously.<br> </p>
         
         <p class="life"> During the 1850s, Dickinson's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert. <br>
         Dickinson eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. <br>
         Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of "most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<br>
        In an 1882 letter to Susan, Dickinson said, "With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living." <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson">(Emily Dickinson)</a></cite><br> </p>


         <p class="life"> On one such social gathering Dickinson met Springfield Republican editor and publisher Samuel Bowles. <br>
             Bowles was impressed by Dickinson's poetry, and published seven poems during her lifetime. <br>
             Dickinson did not give consent for her work to be included, <br>
             but more of her poems appeared in the Springfield Republican during her lifetime than in any other publication.<br>
